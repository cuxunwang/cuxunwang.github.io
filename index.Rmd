**Welcome to the future Wang Mechanics for Brain Health Lab!**

**Xun Wang, Ph.D.** is conducting pioneering interdisciplinary research that applies engineering principles and methods to study human brain and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow working with Profs. [Roger Kamm](https://web.mit.edu/meche/mb/) and [Ming Guo](https://www.guolab.mit.edu/) in the Departments of Mechanical and Biological Engineering at **MIT**, and with Dr. [Se Hoon Choi](https://www.massgeneral.org/neurology/research/genetics-aging-research-unit/choi-lab) in the Genetics and Aging Research Unit of the Department of Neurology and the McCance Center for Brain Health at **Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)** and **Harvard Medical School (HMS)**. 

Before joining MIT and MGH/HMS, Xun researched on biomechanics during morphogenesis — how mechanical forces shape structures in living tissues — in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at **Columbia University** under the supervision of Prof. [Karen Kasza](https://www.kaszalab.com/).

Xun holds an M.S., M.Phil., and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University and a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Automation and a B.A. in German from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
